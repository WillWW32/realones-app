## Our Philosophy

REALones is built on one simple idea: **quality over quantity**. We're a space for your real friends — the people who actually matter in your life. These guidelines help us maintain that vision.

## The Golden Rule

**Treat others how you'd want to be treated.**

If you wouldn't say it to someone's face, don't say it here.
