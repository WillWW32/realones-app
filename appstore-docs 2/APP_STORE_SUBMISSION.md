Your real friends. No algorithm. No ads. Just the 200 people who actually matter.

### Description
```
REALones is the social network for your actual friends — not followers, not influencers, not strangers.

KEEP IT REAL
• Limited to 200 friends — your real circle
• No algorithm — just chronological posts from people you care about
• No ads — ever
• Import friends from Facebook and choose who makes the cut

WHY 200?
Research shows humans can maintain about 150-200 meaningful relationships. We built REALones around this principle. Quality over quantity.

FEATURES
• Invite friends and claim your spot in their top 200
• Swipe to sort who's in and who's out
• Group messaging with your inner circle
• Import your Facebook friends list
• Pure chronological feed — see what your friends post, when they post it

Sometimes a step back is a step forward. Get real with REALones.
