## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I create an account?**  
A: Download REALones from the App Store and sign in with Apple or Google. That's it — no separate registration needed.

**Q: Why is there a 200 friend limit?**  
A: Research by anthropologist Robin Dunbar shows humans can maintain about 150-200 meaningful relationships. We built REALones around this principle: quality over quantity.

**Q: Can I use a username instead of my real name?**  
A: Your display name comes from your Apple/Google account but you can change it in Profile → Edit Profile.
